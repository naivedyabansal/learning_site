What are migrations?
Migrations are a way of moving a database from one design, a specific set of tables and columns, to a new one.
Migrations are reversible, too. The fact that they can be done backwards and forwards is what gives them their name.

url() is a function that constructs a special object that Django uses to join URLs to view functions.

Django projects contain multiple Django apps. Each app generally encompasses a specific area of functionality.
    python manage.py startapp creates the skeleton of an app including the views, models, and tests files.
    INSTALLED_APPS is a list of all apps that Django should consider installed and active for the current project.
    These apps will be used to find templates, tests, models, and migrations.

    TIME_ZONE is the setting for what time zone your server is running in.
