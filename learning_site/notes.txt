What are migrations?

Migrations are a way of moving a database from one design, a specific set of tables and columns, to a new one.
Migrations are reversible, too. The fact that they can be done backwards and forwards is what gives them their name.

url() is a function that constructs a special object that Django uses to join URLs to view functions.
