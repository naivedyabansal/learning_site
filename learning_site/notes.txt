What are migrations?
Migrations are a way of moving a database from one design, a specific set of tables and columns, to a new one.
Migrations are reversible, too. The fact that they can be done backwards and forwards is what gives them their name.

url() is a function that constructs a special object that Django uses to join URLs to view functions.

'''
Django projects contain multiple Django apps. Each app generally encompasses a specific area of functionality.
python manage.py startapp creates the skeleton of an app including the views, models, and tests files.
INSTALLED_APPS is a list of all apps that Django should consider installed and active for the current project.
These apps will be used to find templates, tests, models, and migrations.
python manage.py startapp courses -> command to create new app.
'''

TIME_ZONE is the setting for what time zone your server is running in.

TextField holds an unspecified amount of text.

manage.py commands:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/django-admin/
python manage.py makemigrations [app] will make the migrations for a specific app.
python manage.py migrate [app] will run the pending migrations for a specific app.
If you leave off the app name, any pending migrations for any apps will be run.

python manage.py shell opens a Python shell with Django's configuration already loaded.
Model.save() will save an in-memory instance of a model to the database.
Model.create() will save an in-memory instance of a model to the database and return the newly-created object.
Model.filter(attribute=value) will get a QuerySet of all instances of the Model that match the attribute values.
You can change these values with other comparisons, too, like gte or in. Find out more:
